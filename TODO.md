# TO DO
- Check support for required device functions during initialization (SensorHistory; use exceptions in constructors to throw errors and create a separate error view?)
- Implement getter functions in the app state class
- Use device dependent properties(?) to define the temperature history and chart size
- Add the change log
- Properly process all errors (missing components and variables, null values, etc.)
