# TO DO
- Check support for required device functions during initialization(SensorHistory; use exceptions in constructors to throw errors and create a separate error view?)
- Implement getter functions in the app state class
- Separate the chart into a custom drawable class?
- Use device dependent properties(?) to define the temperature history and chart size
